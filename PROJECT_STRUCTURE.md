# Next.js Project Structure

## Overview

This Next.js project follows a structured organization that emphasizes:

- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with components organized by functionality
- **UI Component Management**:
  - Segregated third-party components (Shadcn)
  - Consistent theming and layout system
- **Asset Organization**: Optimized static asset management in the public directory
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic extraction through custom React hooks
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation throughout the project
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing setup with Vitest

## Key Directories

### components/

React components organized by function:

- `Layouts/`: Reusable layout components
- `Theme/`: Components for interacting with theme (dark/light mode)
- `shadcn/ui/`: Shadcn's components

### pages/

Next.js pages directory for routing:

- `_app.tsx`: Custom App component for global configurations
- `_document.tsx`: Custom Document component for HTML structure
- `index.tsx`: Homepage of the application

### prisma/

Database layer:

- Schema definitions
- Migrations
- Seed data

## File Naming Conventions

You can use your own conventions in your project. For example:

- Component files: PascalCase (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `Header.tsx`)
- Utility files: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`, `helpers.ts`)
- Style files: Same name as component with `.css` extension
- Test files: `*.test.{ts, tsx}` or `*.spec.{ts, tsx}` should be placed alongside their corresponding components for better maintainability

## Additional Notes

This is further notes of your project. For example:

- All components should have their own directory with an index file
- Keep related files close to where they're used
- Follow consistent naming patterns within directories
